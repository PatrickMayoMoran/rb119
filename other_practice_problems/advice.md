# Interview Advice

## Talk / Type Toggle
Try not to say what you are typing while you are typing. This sounds monotone
and makes it hard for the interviewer to listen / watch.

Instead, you can talk a little about what you are going to type, and then type
it in silence. With practice, this toggling between talking and typing will 
become smoother, faster, and easier.

## Think out loud
It is great to take your hands off the keyboard and talk through your thought
process. This is not a waste of your time - this is a great use of your time.
Taking a moment to really think and talk through examples, rules, etc., helps
you get a grasp on the problem as well as communicating that understanding to
the interviewer. Staying quiet means the interviewer is not sure what you are
doing: struggling, succeeding, or something else?

## But it's also okay to say "I'm going to think in silence for a bit"
If you are thinking out loud and get really stuck, or hit some error that really
throws you, it is okay to say - "I'm going to be quiet and think for a minute".
This is keeping the interviewer in the loop of what you're doing. Use this time
to breathe and regroup. Once you've figured out the problem, be sure to share
what you learned and what you're going to do with the interviewer.

## Test as you go
As best you can, stop at each executable line of code, say out loud what you expect
to happen, run the code to check, and verify that you are correct. At worst, this
adds ~1 minute of total time to your interview. At best, this helps you check
along the way and catch and fix bugs early. Also, saying out loud what you expect
and having your code match that - or not match and you fix it - demonstrates
that you are in total control.

## Nerves are okay - learn how yours manifest
Being nervous is normal. Practice interviews are a great way to learn how you
respond when you're stressed/nervous. Do you get tunnel vision? Do you freeze and
can't talk or think? Do you sweat a lot? The more practice interviews you do, the
more you'll learn to expect your body's reactions and be able to process them. 
You don't want to be feeling these sensations for the first time in a real
interview! While nothing can simulate that experience, lots of practice will help.
